# Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (MS SCOM) 2012

> **Note**: You can find our newest SCOM integration, supporting SCOM 2016 and using the latest and greatest in Integration Builder technology, [here](https://www.xmatters.com/integration/microsoft-scom/) This integration should be considered deprecated.


This integration with Microsoft SCOM allows you to locate and notify on-call resolvers when critical network incidents are detected. With the SCOM, the right technician can take direct action on incident tickets in real time from any mobile device.

Network operational and failure information is presented to the message recipient via multiple communication channels, allowing technicians to action updates remotely. As actions are taken, xMatters updates the tickets with informational annotations to provide a full audit trail.
